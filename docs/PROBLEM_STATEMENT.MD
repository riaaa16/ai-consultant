Problem Statement
You are an AI consultant who wants to market your services to businesses that need training, strategic advice, and development support. You need a simple, professional web presence that helps potential clients understand what you offer and contact you easily.

Your goal is to build a proof of concept system that creates and maintains this web presence under the constraints below.

Constraints / Requirements
Hosting
Your site must be hosted on GitHub Pages.

You may not use any paid hosting or subscription-based platforms.

Cost Model
No monthly subscription fees.

AI is allowed only through:

a local LLM, or

a cloud model API where you pay only for tokens used.

Maintainability
Your solution must be easy to maintain.

Updates must be possible without manually editing generated HTML pages.

Redistributable
You may use VS Code (or any tools you want) while building.

But your final solution must be redistributable: someone else should be able to use it without needing extra software beyond what your project includes (other than a browser and a GitHub account).

Painless Setup
Your setup must be beginner-friendly and require minimal steps.

Acceptance test: a classmate can:

fork/clone your repo,

add required keys/config, and

deploy a working site on GitHub Pages
with minimal friction.

Deliverables
Live GitHub Pages URL (your working deployed site)

GitHub repository containing:

a clear README with setup + update instructions

a single source of truth for site content (example: one JSON/YAML/Markdown file)

whatever tooling/scripts/apps you built to generate and update the site

A short proof-of-concept demo showing:

how content is updated

how the site is rebuilt and published

Success Criteria (What “good” looks like)
A visitor can quickly understand:

who you are

what services you offer

how to contact you

You can update content quickly and reliably.

Setup is simple enough that another student can get it working fast.

The solution respects the cost + hosting constraints and is realistically maintainable.
